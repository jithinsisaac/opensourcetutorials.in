In this post, we will see installation methods used in Linux distributions

<!--more-->


When you use Linux, there are be different methods of software installation.
Some of the methods I will try to cover in this post
Before we learn about the package managers, let's see what they do for us

+ Package managers help us to install, uninstall Linux software from the trusted repositories
+ They also help us to fetch dependencies required to install the current package to install in a single command
+ They help to standardise the locations and configuration files at a fixed location decided by the Linux distribution

### Using package managers
