In this post we will discuss why Linux or in general many open source software is free.

- Software is supported by the community which consists of people across the world. Volunteers work in their free time and don't expect anything

- Open source software gets donation and funds from the people and companies who wants the project to sustain and progress

- Many people who get the software free of cost may want it to be customized for them so they pay for its development and features. Newly developed features are again contributed back to open source

- Companies who wants to get great talent make their code open source, like google, Facebook, even Microsoft has made lots of code open source
