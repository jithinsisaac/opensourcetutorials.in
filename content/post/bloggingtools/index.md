In this post, we will look at top open source blogging tools

<!--more-->

We will categories the blogging tools into two categories

+ Static - Generate a static website using data and templates, so the site is prerendered no need to generate the page at the server level. Static sites are normally used by the developers and coders. Here you can write your templates or themes.

+ Dynamic - Here the page is dynamically generated using PHP etc and then served, server level processing is required. All dynamic software need to have a server or some website hosting platforms publish sites, whereas static sites don't need the database or PHP etc for the content to be rendered.


Static sites are good if you don't want to keep the headache of the management of the websites and want to just focus on the blogging.

You can host you static blogs on GitHub or GitLab also.
