Choosing right Linux distribution

<!--more-->

> Which distribution should I use ?

This is often a big question to all new Linux users. When you are introduced to the world of Linux and you experiment a little bit with Linux environment. You might be tempted to many other Linux distributions.

Even I was tempted and tried lots of distributions, but then settled on Ubuntu, the reasons for that are as follows

+ I use software which is dependent on other libraries. These libraries are well supported on Ubuntu distributions
+ I wanted Linux distribution which is well supported on a cloud like OpenStack which is well integrated on Ubuntu flavors
+ Servers and many documentations are available on either on Redhat or Ubuntu based flavors

So I am finally settled on the Ubuntu distribution.

These are two websites which you can use and see which Linux distributions suites you

+ https://distrochooser.de/en/  by the Christoph MÃ¼ller

Top 10 Linux flavors as per many websites are as flollows, numbers

+ Linux Mint : https://linuxmint.com/
+ Ubuntu : https://www.ubuntu.com/
+ Debian : https://www.debian.org/
+ Fedora : https://getfedora.org/
+ Elementary OS : https://elementary.io/
+ CentOs : https://www.centos.org/
+ Arch Linux : https://www.archlinux.org/
+ Zorin : https://zorinos.com/
+ OpenSuse : https://www.opensuse.org/
+ Deepin : https://www.deepin.org/en/

All above distributions differ based on following points

+ Release Frequency, six months or year, stable realease only, rolling realease
+ Focus on user interface example Elementry OS
+ Privacy First
+ Customization if first priority
+ Beginners first distribution

So, do your research, based on the needs you can choose Linux distributions
