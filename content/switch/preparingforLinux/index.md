If you have purchased a new Desktop PC then it might have nothing installed on it. If new PC doenst have any OS installed on it, your PC already ready for the Linux installation.

I assume that your Laptop or PC has installed Windows 8 or 10

Summary of key points

+ For installation of Linux you need a partition which is not formatted or unformatted
+ Yoy may have some partitions already on your machine, You need to make one partition which is preferable last partitions like out of the C, D, and E then make free E partition
+ You should take full backup of all the data fom your machine a sigle mistake might wipe out your data
+ Once you have free partition then you can delete the partition from disk management utility, this will make free space available


There are two ways in which we can install Linux

+ Dual Boot install
+ Linux only

If you want to install only Linux then you need to ensure full backup of data as new installation will erase entire disk.

Now if you have decided to make it dual boot then as mentioned earlier that you need to make last partition free.

If your machine has only one big C partition then you need to shrink the partition from the "Disk management tool". [You can see this video for demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJiakVgAtn4)

Once the drive is shrinked you will get the additional free disk.

Remember that you need unformatted disk for Linux installation. It must not be of any type like NTFS etc.
