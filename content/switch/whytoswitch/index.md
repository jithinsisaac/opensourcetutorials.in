I would like to ask the following questions to you

+ Are you tired of Virus and Antivirus game?
+ Are you the victim of virus and your files get corrupted?
+ Do you need a stable and secure operating system?
+ Are you concern about the privacy and your personal data?
+ Want to try something new to learn and bored with your computer?
+ Are you a student and wants to explore the work of software development etc.
+ Do you want to become a software developer, or ethical hacker or machine learning expert?
+ Do you want to become system administrator?
+ Do you want to control every aspect of the operating system?
+ Do you want to learn to code from open source environment and contribute so great projects?

If you answer the above questions and most of the answers are yes, then I think definitely need to try the Linux operating system and need to understand the entire open source software model how it works.

Most of the advanced fields like AI, ML, Cloud, IOT, Big Data software are open source and fully supported only on Linux operating system
